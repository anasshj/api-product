## Testing with Postman
1. **Set up Postman**:
   - Create a collection named `Product API`.
   - Add requests for all endpoints.
2. **Execute Requests**:
   - Validate responses for each endpoint (e.g., GET returns products, POST adds a product, etc.).
3. **Generate a Report**:
   - Run the collection using the Collection Runner.
   - Export results as JSON or HTML.

## Publish Project on GitHub
1. **Initialize Git**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Create Repository**:
   - On GitHub, create a new repository (e.g., `product-api`).
   - Copy the repository URL.

3. **Push Code**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/anasshj/api-product.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
